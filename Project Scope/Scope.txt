Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

Project Summary

A customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments.
In this project, the queries will be handled in a better way. If the customer's question is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service and we can handle the queries in a better way.
We will build a chatbot that uses various Watson AI Services like Watson Discovery, Watson Assistant, Watson Cloud functions and Node-Red and deliver an effective user friendly Web User Interface.
